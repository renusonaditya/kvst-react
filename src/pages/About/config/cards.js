    subtitle: `Sri Kashi Vishwanath temple is an ancient Hindu temple built in
    the year <br />
    1859 by Sri Kandukuri Venkata Ramayya during the time of Nizam
    VI <br />
    Mir Mahboob Ali Khan.`,
    description: `Kandukuri Venkata Ramayya was richest baniya during the time
    of Nizam. <br />
    As there was untouchability prevailing during the times,
    Dalits were not <br />
    allowed to enter the temple. In order to provide entry for
    devotees of all <br />
    communities into the temple, the temple was constructed by his
    own money <br />
    without collecting funds from anyone. During the time of
    construction, <br />
    there were many hurdles created by Nizam government in order
    to stop the <br />
    construction of temple. As the Razakars used to demolish the
    temple in the <br />
    day time, the construction used to take place during the night
    time. As this <br />
    continues for few days, Lord Shiva appeared in the dream of
    Kandukuri <br />
    Venkata Ramayya and said “Do not fear constructing my temple.
    Continue <br />
    constructing the temple during day time without any fear”.
    Temple was almost <br />
    completed and Nizam army handcuffed Venkata Ramayya and tried
    to take him into the prison. Immediately the handcuffs turned
    to flower garland. <br />
    There after he was sent to jail in Mumbai with respect for few
    days. He has completed the construction of temple using his
    influence while he was in the jail. <br />
    Later on, he was released from the jail. He continued
    organizing Nitya Puja and Performed several Homas in the
    temple.<br /><br/>  Idols situated in the temple were sculpted in the Dashashwamedh
    Ghat of Varanasi.<br/><br/> Temple was maintained by his son Kandukuri Badraiah after his
    demise and at present his descendants are taking care of the
    temple.`,
